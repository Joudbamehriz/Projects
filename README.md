Hi my name is Joud Bamehriz and this repository serves as a portfolio for all the projects Iworked on throughout my undergraduate years. 
I am currently finishing up my Bachelor of Science in Engineering Physics at Eastern Michigan University. As a student I worked on a bunch of research projects that helped me develop many skills. 
Some of these skills are: 
-Using AutoCAD to design 2d living spaces from different viewing prespictives and 3d objects. 
-Working with massive sets of data to come up with a mathematical model that can further predict values of specific variables.
-Utilizing a global climate model of the upper atmosphere of mars known as MGITM and writing some code files that help compare the model's results to NASA's MAVEN data. 

In this repository I plan to showcase examples of each of those skills as best as possible.
